# FIPS IPv6 Adapter

The IPv6 adapter sits above the FIPS Session Protocol (FSP) and adapts the
FIPS datagram service for unmodified IPv6 applications. It presents each FIPS
node as an IPv6 endpoint, so standard socket applications (SSH, HTTP, SCP)
can communicate over the mesh without modification.

## Role

The adapter bridges two worlds: IPv6 applications that address destinations by
IP address, and the FIPS mesh that addresses destinations by public key
(npub). The adapter handles the translation: DNS resolution from npub to
`fd00::/8` ULA (Unique Local Address) address, identity cache management so
FIPS can route IPv6 packets,
MTU enforcement so packets fit through the mesh, and the TUN interface that
connects to the kernel's IPv6 stack.

Applications that are FIPS-aware can bypass the adapter entirely and use the
native FIPS datagram API, addressing destinations directly by npub.

## DNS Integration

### The Problem

IPv6 addresses in the `fd00::/8` range are derived from public keys via a
one-way hash (SHA-256). Given only an IPv6 address, the public key cannot be
recovered — and without the public key, FIPS cannot compute the node_addr
needed for routing.

The identity cache must be populated *before* packets arrive at the TUN
interface, or they cannot be routed.

### DNS as Entry Point

DNS resolution serves as the "routing intent" signal. When an application
resolves `npub1xxx...xxx.fips`, the FIPS DNS service:

1. Extracts the npub from the `.fips` domain name
2. Derives the `fd00::/8` IPv6 address from the public key
3. Primes the identity cache with the mapping
   (IPv6 address prefix ↔ NodeAddr ↔ PublicKey)
4. Returns the IPv6 address to the application

When the application subsequently sends packets to that address, the identity
cache already contains the mapping needed for routing.

### DNS Name Format

```text
npub1xxxxxx...xxxxx.fips
```

The FIPS DNS server recognizes names ending in `.fips` and extracts the npub
for address derivation.

### Traffic Without Prior DNS Lookup

A packet may arrive at the TUN for an `fd00::/8` destination without a prior DNS
lookup — cached address, manual configuration, etc. Since the address derivation
is one-way, the npub cannot be recovered from the address alone.

FIPS returns ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable (Code 0: No route to destination)
for packets to unknown addresses. The identity cache must be populated before
traffic can be routed.

Known cache population mechanisms:

- **DNS lookup**: The primary path
- **Inbound traffic**: Authenticated sessions from other nodes populate the
  cache with their identity information

## IPv6 Address Derivation

FIPS addresses use the IPv6 Unique Local Address (ULA) prefix `fd00::/8`:

```text
Public Key (32 bytes)
    │
    ▼
SHA-256 → node_addr (16 bytes, truncated)
    │
    ▼
fd + node_addr[0..15] → IPv6 address (16 bytes)
```

The `fd` prefix places FIPS addresses in the IPv6 Unique Local Address (ULA)
space defined by RFC 4193. ULAs are the IPv6 equivalent of RFC 1918 private
addresses (10.x, 172.16.x, 192.168.x) — they are reserved for local use and
are not routable over the public Internet. This means FIPS overlay addresses
cannot conflict with native IPv6 traffic that may be present on the same host
or network, and they will not leak beyond the local system even if routing is
misconfigured. These are overlay identifiers — they appear in the TUN
interface for application compatibility but have no meaning outside the FIPS
mesh.

## Identity Cache

The derivation from public key to NodeAddr and IPv6 address is one-way
(SHA-256 truncation). Given a destination IPv6 address from an outbound packet
on the TUN interface, the adapter cannot recover the public key or NodeAddr
needed for FIPS routing. The identity cache provides the reverse lookup:
it maps the FIPS address prefix (15 bytes — the IPv6 address minus the `fd`
prefix) back to `(NodeAddr, PublicKey)`, allowing the adapter to route
IPv6 traffic into the mesh. This cache is needed only when using the IPv6
adapter; the native FIPS API provides the public key directly.

### Eviction Policy

The mapping is deterministic (derived from the public key) and never becomes
stale. The cache uses **LRU-only eviction** bounded by a configurable size
(default 10K entries). There is no TTL — entries are evicted only when the
cache is full and space is needed for a new entry. LRU-only eviction is
necessary because there is no other way for the FIPS router to recover the
routing identity from an IPv6 address, and IPv6 traffic for a destination may
arrive an arbitrarily long time after the DNS resolution that populated the
cache entry.

### Relationship to DNS TTL

The identity cache timeout must be longer than the DNS TTL to ensure that while
an application believes its DNS resolution is valid, the corresponding routing
entry remains present. The DNS TTL (default 300s) governs when applications
re-query; the identity cache (LRU, no TTL) is always available as long as the
entry hasn't been evicted by memory pressure.

## MTU Enforcement

FIPS does not provide fragmentation or reassembly at the session or mesh
protocol layers — every datagram must fit in a single transport-layer packet.
Some transports may perform fragmentation and reassembly internally (e.g., BLE
L2CAP) and can advertise a larger virtual MTU than the physical medium
supports, but this is transparent to FIPS. The mesh layer provides two
facilities to manage MTU across heterogeneous paths: route discovery can
constrain results to paths that support a required minimum MTU, and transit
nodes that cannot forward an oversized datagram send an MtuExceeded error
signal back to the source. The adapter must ensure that IPv6 packets from
applications fit within the FIPS encapsulation budget after all layers of
wrapping.

### Encapsulation Overhead

| Layer | Overhead | Purpose |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| Link encryption | 37 bytes | 16-byte outer header + 5-byte inner header (timestamp + msg_type) + 16-byte AEAD tag |
| SessionDatagram body | 35 bytes | ttl + path_mtu + src_addr + dest_addr (msg_type counted in inner header) |
| FSP header | 12 bytes | 4-byte prefix + 8-byte counter (used as AEAD AAD) |
| FSP inner header | 6 bytes | 4-byte timestamp + 1-byte msg_type + 1-byte inner_flags (inside AEAD) |
| Session AEAD tag | 16 bytes | ChaCha20-Poly1305 tag on session-encrypted payload |
| **Protocol envelope** | **106 bytes** | `FIPS_OVERHEAD` constant |
| Port header | 4 bytes | src_port + dst_port (DataPacket service dispatch) |
| IPv6 compression | −33 bytes | 40-byte IPv6 header → 7-byte format + residual |
| **IPv6 data path total** | **77 bytes** | `FIPS_IPV6_OVERHEAD` constant |

Coordinate piggybacking (CP flag) adds variable overhead: `2 + entries × 16`
per coordinate, with both src and dst coords sent. The send path skips the
CP flag if adding coords would exceed the transport MTU.

The `FIPS_OVERHEAD` constant (106 bytes) represents the base protocol
envelope overhead (link encryption + routing + session encryption). For IPv6
traffic, FSP port multiplexing adds 4 bytes (port header) while IPv6 header
compression saves 33 bytes (40-byte header → 7-byte format + residual),
yielding a net `FIPS_IPV6_OVERHEAD` of 77 bytes.

### Effective IPv6 MTU

The effective IPv6 MTU visible to applications is:

```text
effective_ipv6_mtu = transport_mtu - FIPS_IPV6_OVERHEAD
```

For typical deployments:

| Transport MTU | Effective IPv6 MTU | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| 1472 (UDP/Ethernet) | 1395 | Standard deployment |
| 1280 (UDP minimum) | 1203 | Below IPv6 minimum |

IPv6 mandates that every link support at least 1280 bytes. The minimum
transport path MTU for the IPv6 adapter is therefore:

```text
1280 + 77 = 1357 bytes
```

Transports with smaller MTUs (radio at ~250 bytes, serial at 256 bytes) cannot
support the IPv6 adapter without some form of internal fragmentation and
reassembly. Otherwise, applications on those transports must use the native
FIPS datagram API.

### ICMP Packet Too Big

When an outbound packet at the TUN exceeds the effective IPv6 MTU, the adapter
generates an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message and delivers it back to the
application via the TUN. This triggers the kernel's Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
mechanism, which adjusts TCP segment sizes for subsequent transmissions.

ICMP Packet Too Big generation is rate-limited per source address (100ms
interval) to prevent storms from applications sending many oversized packets.

The ICMP response is delivered locally (back through the TUN to the kernel) —
no network traversal is needed, so delivery is reliable.

### TCP MSS Clamping

The adapter intercepts TCP SYN and SYN-ACK packets at the TUN interface and
clamps the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option:

```text
clamped_mss = effective_ipv6_mtu - 40 (IPv6 header) - 20 (TCP header)
```

This prevents TCP connections from negotiating segment sizes that would exceed
the FIPS path MTU. Clamping is applied in two places:

- **TUN reader** (outbound): Clamps MSS on outbound SYN packets
- **TUN writer** (inbound): Clamps MSS on inbound SYN-ACK packets

Together, these ensure both directions of a TCP connection use appropriately
sized segments from the start, avoiding the initial oversized packet loss
that would occur with ICMP Packet Too Big alone.

### ICMP Rate Limiting

ICMPv6 error generation is rate-limited per source address using a token bucket
(100ms interval). This matches the standard ICMP rate limiting approach and
prevents amplification when an application sends a burst of oversized packets.

## TUN Interface

The TUN device (`fips0`) is the mechanism that connects the adapter to the
kernel's IPv6 stack. It is an implementation detail of the adapter, not its
defining feature.

### Architecture

```text
Applications (sockets using fd00::/8 addresses)
       │
       ▼
Kernel IPv6 Stack (routing: fd00::/8 → fips0)
       │
       ▼
TUN Device (fips0)
    ├── Reader Thread (blocking I/O → packet processing)
    └── Writer Thread (mpsc queue → TUN writes)
```

### Reader Thread

The TUN reader receives raw IPv6 packets from applications and processes them:

1. Validate IPv6 header
2. Extract destination `fd00::/8` address
3. Look up identity cache — miss returns ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
4. Retrieve NodeAddr and PublicKey from cache
5. Look up or establish FSP session
6. Compress IPv6 header: strip addresses and payload length, build format 0x00
   payload with residual fields (traffic class, flow label, next header, hop limit)
7. Prepend port header (src_port=256, dst_port=256)
8. Encrypt with session keys
9. Route through FMP toward destination

### Writer Thread

A single writer thread services an mpsc queue of outbound packets:

- Inbound mesh traffic on port 256 (IPv6 header reconstructed from session
  context + residual fields, then delivered as complete IPv6 packets)
- ICMPv6 error responses (Packet Too Big, Destination Unreachable)
- TCP MSS-clamped SYN-ACK packets

The queue-based design eliminates contention on TUN writes and cleanly
separates concerns. New packet sources can be added by cloning the sender
handle.

### Local Address Guarantee

The Linux kernel routing table processes rules in priority order:

1. **Local table**: Intercepts traffic to addresses assigned to this machine
2. **Main table**: Routes `fd00::/8` to the TUN device

This means every packet arriving at the TUN reader is guaranteed to be for a
*remote* FIPS destination. No "is this for me?" check is needed on the read
path.

### Configuration

```yaml
tun:
  enabled: true
  name: fips0
  mtu: 1280
```

### Privileges

TUN device creation requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. Options:

- Run as root
- Set capability: `sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep ./target/debug/fips`
- Pre-created persistent TUN device

## Design Considerations

### Path MTU Discovery

Two complementary mechanisms support full PMTUD:

1. **Proactive**: The `path_mtu` field (2 bytes) in the SessionDatagram envelope
   is implemented at the FMP level. The source sets it to its outbound link MTU
   minus overhead; each transit node applies
   `min(current, own_outbound_mtu - overhead)`. The destination receives the
   forward-path minimum. PathMtuNotification is handled at the session layer;
   the destination sends the observed forward-path MTU back to the source,
   which applies it with decrease-immediate / increase-requires-3-consecutive
   hysteresis.

2. **Reactive**: When a transit node cannot forward a packet (MTU exceeded), it
   sends an error signal back to the source. This handles the in-flight gap
   between a path MTU decrease and the source learning via the echo.

Both are needed: proactive handles steady state; reactive handles the transient
window when oversized packets hit a new bottleneck before the source adapts.

### No Fragmentation

FIPS remains a pure datagram service with no fragmentation at transit nodes.
Session-layer encryption is end-to-end — the AEAD tag authenticates the entire
plaintext. Fragmenting encrypted datagrams would require either exposing
plaintext structure to transit nodes (unacceptable) or reassembly before
decryption (opens attack surface).
